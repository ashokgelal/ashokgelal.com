I'm more of a tea drinker than coffee. But also I drink fair amount of coffee everyday esp. at work.

Today I learned that [both tea and coffee are considered to be healthy][1]. There are no known risk of disease by consuming either of these world's most popular beverages. Of course, there is the side effect of drinking them too much and not able to sleep. But by that logic everything in this world is bad for your health.

Here are some of the highlights from this article published on [Harvard School of Public Health's website][1]:

### Tea

> * drinking at least three cups of either black or green tea per day reduces the risk of stroke and cancer.

> * skimmed milk significantly reduced the antioxidant capacity of tea. The fattier milks also reduced the antioxidant capacity of tea, but to a lesser degree.
 
> * even tea with milk is a healthy drink.

> * research on the effects of green tea and fat reduction have shown little promise of weight loss benefits.

> * it’s best to skip any so-called “diet” teas that may contain potentially harmful substances such as laxatives.

> * three benefits - reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, protection from cancer, and reduced risk of high blood pressure.
