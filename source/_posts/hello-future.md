> "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." - **Lao Tzu**

I have been thinking about working on a simple web project for couple of weeks now. I will go into more details about the project in a future post but for now let me tell you why I am here. 

Usually when I get an idea for an app and decide to make it happen, I just go ahead and start implementing it. I usually start with describing some features. Then after drawing some mock-ups, I get straight into coding.

This process has worked fairly well for all my side projects - failed or successful ones. As I go from an idea to completing the project, I end up researching and learning a lots of new things. The problem is that it does not take me too long to forget them. I miss an opportunity to document my learning for future references. And thus I have also lost a chance to share them with other people. 

I am very religious and disciplined when it comes to coding. Programming is much art as it is science. So, I practice it by writing code outside my day job almost every day. I enjoy hacking on a side project and learning something new in the process. Unfortunately, I have not been disciplined about blogging regularly. I have tried couple of times and failed. 

What sucks even more is that couple of things I have written have been successful. Readers have appreciated my tutorials writing skills too. They have made to the front pages of Lifehacker and Digg. But I have not been good at giving blogging any attention. Once I get deep into coding a project I tend to forget the outside world. 

But this time I have decided to write things down as I learn and then share them with the world and future myself. My hope is that this will help me document all my processes. I can come back and see what worked well and what did not. Hence, this blog. 

This new journey is going to be long. But this post is the first step I needed to take. I was nervous as I was even thinking about setting up a blog. But as I am nearing to write final sentences of it, I am relieved to have taken that first step. Now let's see how far I can go. 

Please come back for some in-depth tutorials, some quick tips, and some other things I have learned during this journey. For now, follow me on [@hello_infuture](https://twitter.com/hello_infuture)
