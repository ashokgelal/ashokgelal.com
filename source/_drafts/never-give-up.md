> *"Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable."* - **Joe Biden**


I have some friends who have been trying to get a job for more than a year now. All of them are engineers - some mechanical and some electrical. They have graduated from a good university as well.

Sometimes they talk about giving it up and going and working for Walmart for an example. I tell them that no work is small. Yet it would be a disservice to aim for anything less than what they are destined for. It would be a disservice not just to their degrees but to this country and to their own family as well.

I have been consistently encouraging them to get a master's in Computer Science. They could do master's in their own field of study. But to be honest, I do not see good job markets for electrical engineers or mechanical engineers. I am not saying there are no jobs at all. But it looks like you either have to be lucky or have to be super smart to land a job in these fields. And that is what they tell me as well. Also I think they would completely break down if they get a master's degree and still struggle to find a decent job.

When I tell them to go to masters they hesitate. They tell me that they have already spent 4-5 years on getting an undergrad degree. They don't want to spent another 2-3 years on it. Maybe they are right but it is never too late to start something new.

They are still under 30 and may well have another 30 years of job life. They are not going to look back and say "that was a waste of 2 years". Not at least if they do good and land a good job. 2-3 years is not small in itself but in the grand scheme of 30-40 years, 2-3 years is nothing.

And it is not a waste of time even if they couldn't land a job. People spent years and years of their life way into their 60s and 70s to get more knowledge. Knowledge is no waste.

Anyway, I have been doing my best to keep these friends motivated. I can feel their frustrations. Your friends and family look up on you. They have an expectation on you to do well in professional life. When your college friends have good jobs and you are still emailing out 2-3 resumes daily, it must kill you inside.

Today I stumbled up on [Liz Beigle-Bryant's success story on codeacademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/stories/102). She says, "sell yourself long, do not sell yourself short." She started a new career at 55 and seems to be happy not giving up.

And that's what I want from my friends - to never give up but to give everything to find that successful career. Costco or Walmart or McDonald's is not the answer. You cannot win by taking revenge on your own life. Especially if you haven't done anything heinous. Yes, the past cannot be brought back. But the future awaits for something bigger and the present  wants you to not give up.
